#Assignment 1 : Calculate the area and circumference when radius of circle is given.
#Assignment 2 : Calcualte the perimeter of a traingle when 3 sides are given
#Stages : Input, Process, Output

#Assignment1 Solution is below:
radius_circle = 5
area_circle =3.14*radius_circle**2
circumference_circle = 2*3.14*radius_circle

print(f"area and circumfrence of circle is =,{area_circle} and {circumference_circle:.2f}")
#Answer is: area and circumfrence of circle is =,78.5 and 31.40

#Assignment2
sideA_traingle = 5
sideB_traingle = 6
sideC_traingle = 7
perimeter_of_traingle=sideA_traingle+sideB_traingle+sideC_traingle

print(f"Perimeter of Traingle is {perimeter_of_traingle} when the sides are given 5,6 & 7")
#Answer is here: Perimeter of Traingle is 18 when the sides are given 5,6 & 7
